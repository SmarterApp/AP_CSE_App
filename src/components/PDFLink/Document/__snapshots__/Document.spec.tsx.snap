The **item stem of PART B** will pose a question about the details that support the analysis made in PART A. This part of the item will provide students the opportunity to identify the textual evidence used to make the analysis.

The **answer choices of PART B** will be selectable lines, sentences, or paragraphs from the text, or other selectable text.
