    <p>
      A core principle of the Smarter Balanced system is accessibility for students who take the
      test. Accessibility resources provided on Smarter Balanced assessments ensure equitable access
      for students with diverse accessibility needs and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smarter Balanced tests are designed so that students who take them—including students who are
      learning English or have special needs—can participate in the tests meaningfully and
      demonstrate what they know and can do. As a result, our end-of-year test includes
      accessibility resources that address visual, auditory, and physical access barriers—allowing
      virtually all students to show what they know and can do without compromising the assessment
      construct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utilizing the principles of universal design, these accessibility resources include Braille,
      stacked Spanish translations, videos in American Sign Language, glossaries provided in 10
      languages and several dialects, as well as translated test directions in 19 languages. Each of
      these accessibility resources was built with students in mind and would be cost prohibitive
      for any state to create on its own.

    <h3>How should I use the item specifications?</h3>
    <p>The Item Specifications can be used in several different ways across the school year.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One use of the Item specification is knowledge. Educators can study the specifications to
        learn the connections between the content standards and the claims and targets. Educators
        will learn that the targets are a very useful “packaging” of the content standards. Which
        leads to another use—instruction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Classroom teachers may sometimes find themselves struggling to develop classroom assessments
        that align faithfully to the content and rigor of the standards. The item specifications
        serve as a guide for teachers in developing classroom assessments. Each item specification
        includes information on writing questions, stimuli considerations, accessibility awareness,
        depth of knowledge requirements, and more. Look for future professional development modules
        in the Digital Library to assist in unpacking the item specifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        District-level administrators, such as curriculum coordinators, may use the item
        specifications as a means for developing a deeper understanding of content deficiencies as
        discovered through interim and summative assessment reports. Reporting categories align with
        the claim and target structure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What does “CAT” mean?</h3>
    <p>
      CAT is the acronym for Computer Adaptive Test. The computer-based test adjusts the difficulty
      of questions throughout the assessment based on the student’s response. If a student answers a
      question correctly, the next question will be harder; if a student answers incorrectly, the
      next question will be easier. This system is called computer adaptive testing, and it is part
      of the summative (end-of-year) assessments. More information about{' '}
      <a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/assessments/testing-technology/">
        computer adaptive testing
      </a>{' '}
      can be found on the Smarter Balanced website.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a test blueprint?</h3>
    <p>
      Test blueprints describe the content of the English language arts/literacy and mathematics
      assessments (interim and summative) for grades 3–8 and high school—and how that content will
      be assessed.
    </p>
    <h3>What kinds of questions will the students encounter on the SB?</h3>
    <p>
      There are 12 different technology-enhanced item types used by Smarter Balanced. Definitions of
      each item type and sample of each item type can be found on the{' '}
      <a href="http://sampleitems.smarterbalanced.org/AboutItems">Sample Items website</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Can the students use a calculator on the mathematics assessment?</h3>
    <p>
      Smarter Balanced and Desmos are proud to offer calculators that are both free to students and
      include cutting edge accessibility features. Students are allowed to use a calculator on a
      certain percentage of mathematics items, depending on the construct being assessed.{' '}

    The Performance Tasks in English language arts (ELA) and mathematics will provide measures of
    students’ achievement (proficiency in meeting grade-level standards), academic growth, and
    progress toward college and career readiness. The domain of performance assessment is quite
    broad, encompassing a range of response tasks. A Smarter Balanced performance task involves
    significant interaction of students with stimulus materials and/or engagement in a problem
    solution, ultimately leading to an exhibition of the students’ application of knowledge and
    skills, often in writing or spoken language. Stimuli include a variety of information forms, as
    well as an assignment or problem situation.
