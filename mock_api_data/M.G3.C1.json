A Level 2 assessment item requires students to make some decisions as to how to approach the problem or activity, whereas Level 1 requires students to demonstrate a rote response, perform a well-known algorithm, follow a set procedure (like a recipe), or perform a clearly defined series of steps. Keywords that generally distinguish a Level 2 item include \"classify,\" \"organize,\" \"estimate,\" \"make observations,\" \"collect and display data,\" and \"compare data.\" These actions imply more than one step. For example, to compare data requires first identifying characteristics of the objects or phenomenon and then grouping or ordering the objects. Some action verbs, such as \"explain,\" \"describe,\" or \"interpret\" could be classified at different levels depending on the object of the action. For example, if an item required students to explain how light affects mass by indicating there is a relationship between light and heat, this is considered a Level 2. Interpreting information from a simple graph, requiring reading information from the graph, also is a Level 2. Interpreting information from a complex graph that requires some decisions on what features of the graph need to be considered and how information from the graph can be aggregated is a Level 3. Caution is warranted in interpreting Level 2 as only skills because some reviewers will interpret skills very narrowly, as primarily numerical skills, and such interpretation excludes from this level other skills such as visualization skills and probability skills, which may be more complex simply because they are less common. Other Level 2 activities include explaining the purpose and use of experimental procedures; carrying out experimental procedures; making observations and collecting data; classifying, organizing, and comparing data; and organizing and displaying data in tables, graphs, and charts.",

A Level 2 assessment item requires students to make some decisions as to how to approach the problem or activity, whereas Level 1 requires students to demonstrate a rote response, perform a well-known algorithm, follow a set procedure (like a recipe), or perform a clearly defined series of steps. Keywords that generally distinguish a Level 2 item include \"classify,\" \"organize,\" \"estimate,\" \"make observations,\" \"collect and display data,\" and \"compare data.\" These actions imply more than one step. For example, to compare data requires first identifying characteristics of the objects or phenomenon and then grouping or ordering the objects. Some action verbs, such as \"explain,\" \"describe,\" or \"interpret\" could be classified at different levels depending on the object of the action. For example, if an item required students to explain how light affects mass by indicating there is a relationship between light and heat, this is considered a Level 2. Interpreting information from a simple graph, requiring reading information from the graph, also is a Level 2. Interpreting information from a complex graph that requires some decisions on what features of the graph need to be considered and how information from the graph can be aggregated is a Level 3. Caution is warranted in interpreting Level 2 as only skills because some reviewers will interpret skills very narrowly, as primarily numerical skills, and such interpretation excludes from this level other skills such as visualization skills and probability skills, which may be more complex simply because they are less common. Other Level 2 activities include explaining the purpose and use of experimental procedures; carrying out experimental procedures; making observations and collecting data; classifying, organizing, and comparing data; and organizing and displaying data in tables, graphs, and charts.",

A Level 2 assessment item requires students to make some decisions as to how to approach the problem or activity, whereas Level 1 requires students to demonstrate a rote response, perform a well-known algorithm, follow a set procedure (like a recipe), or perform a clearly defined series of steps. Keywords that generally distinguish a Level 2 item include \"classify,\" \"organize,\" \"estimate,\" \"make observations,\" \"collect and display data,\" and \"compare data.\" These actions imply more than one step. For example, to compare data requires first identifying characteristics of the objects or phenomenon and then grouping or ordering the objects. Some action verbs, such as \"explain,\" \"describe,\" or \"interpret\" could be classified at different levels depending on the object of the action. For example, if an item required students to explain how light affects mass by indicating there is a relationship between light and heat, this is considered a Level 2. Interpreting information from a simple graph, requiring reading information from the graph, also is a Level 2. Interpreting information from a complex graph that requires some decisions on what features of the graph need to be considered and how information from the graph can be aggregated is a Level 3. Caution is warranted in interpreting Level 2 as only skills because some reviewers will interpret skills very narrowly, as primarily numerical skills, and such interpretation excludes from this level other skills such as visualization skills and probability skills, which may be more complex simply because they are less common. Other Level 2 activities include explaining the purpose and use of experimental procedures; carrying out experimental procedures; making observations and collecting data; classifying, organizing, and comparing data; and organizing and displaying data in tables, graphs, and charts.",

To assess whether students have met this goal, tasks for this target should include fractions greater than 1 as well as fractions less than or equal to 1; and tasks should not handle fractions differently based on whether they are greater than, less than, or equal to 1. Fractions equal to whole numbers (such as 3/1) should also commonly appear in these tasks. Two equal fractions may be referred to as equal, without need for the term “equivalent” (e.g., “which fraction equals 3?”), and fractions may be referred to simply as numbers (e.g., “which number is greatest?” with fractions among the answer choices).\r\n\r\n[1] Note that area models, strip diagram models, and number line models of a/b are all essentially special cases of the core fraction concept as defined in 3.NF.A.1: namely, a parts when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts.

A Level 2 assessment item requires students to make some decisions as to how to approach the problem or activity, whereas Level 1 requires students to demonstrate a rote response, perform a well-known algorithm, follow a set procedure (like a recipe), or perform a clearly defined series of steps. Keywords that generally distinguish a Level 2 item include \"classify,\" \"organize,\" \"estimate,\" \"make observations,\" \"collect and display data,\" and \"compare data.\" These actions imply more than one step. For example, to compare data requires first identifying characteristics of the objects or phenomenon and then grouping or ordering the objects. Some action verbs, such as \"explain,\" \"describe,\" or \"interpret\" could be classified at different levels depending on the object of the action. For example, if an item required students to explain how light affects mass by indicating there is a relationship between light and heat, this is considered a Level 2. Interpreting information from a simple graph, requiring reading information from the graph, also is a Level 2. Interpreting information from a complex graph that requires some decisions on what features of the graph need to be considered and how information from the graph can be aggregated is a Level 3. Caution is warranted in interpreting Level 2 as only skills because some reviewers will interpret skills very narrowly, as primarily numerical skills, and such interpretation excludes from this level other skills such as visualization skills and probability skills, which may be more complex simply because they are less common. Other Level 2 activities include explaining the purpose and use of experimental procedures; carrying out experimental procedures; making observations and collecting data; classifying, organizing, and comparing data; and organizing and displaying data in tables, graphs, and charts.",

Technology-enhanced tasks could involve partitioning a shape into parts with equal areas; more traditional tasks could involve expressing the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole. For these tasks, shapes may be partitioned into non-rectangular parts; for example, students will use intuitive ideas about area to reason that a square with both diagonals drawn has been partitioned into four equal parts. \r\n\r\nOther tasks for this target will connect less directly to other material in the grade, continuing the standards’ progression of increasingly sophisticated spatial and logical reasoning about shapes and their attributes (cf. 2.G.1). Most of these tasks will assess understanding of the hierarchy of quadrilaterals as detailed in 3.G.A.1. A few tasks may involve categories of shapes not explicitly mentioned in the standard, so as to assess understanding of property-based categorization per se at this level. For example, a regular octagon and a rectangle might be shown and the student asked to select a category to which both figures belong—e.g., figures that can be partitioned into triangles—and then to produce a figure not belonging to that category (e.g., a circle).",
