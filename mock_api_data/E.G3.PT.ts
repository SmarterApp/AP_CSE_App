    'clarification': '-   Performance Task (PT): In general, the PT should allow students to demonstrate deeper thinking and allow more integration of information from resources. Sources should cover the subject sufficiently enough to allow students to develop a main idea, but not be too general.\r\n\r\n-   Choosing Sources: Overall, the sources should offer more factual information and citations than just unsupported opinions. Stories or other works of fiction are not appropriate for the Grade 3–5 research tasks. Do not use literary fiction in the Grade 3-5 tasks.\r\n\r\n-   Each performance task (PT) should be as unique as possible. Within a PT set, stimuli may, however, be used in more than one PT if necessary and important to the task. This must be done cautiously and to a limited extent only. There should be different companion stimuli and, in addition, the two PTs must not have the same focus. Choose sources with writing assignment in mind. Think about writing assignment and whether sources provide enough information for an appropriate informational full write. Try not to create a writing assignment around a set of sources – the writing purpose **should come from the sources** and not be a forced fit.\r\n\r\n-   Claim 4 Targets: Target 2 will focus on choosing text and visual elements that support a research central idea, key detail, and/or given purpose as well as the integration of notes into a central idea or key detail category. Target 3 will focus on analyzing sources in order to locate additional information, such as relevant sources of information and relevant information from visual elements that will enhance an existing piece of student writing. Target 4 will focus on using/selecting evidence to support an opinion or an idea.\r\n\r\n-   Research Questions: The three research questions must represent at least two different Claim 4 targets. Within a PT set, an item task model for a research question (RQ) can be used across PTs.',

    'accessibility': 'Students will be required to read short and long stimuli, interpret information from text and/or graphic sources, and use a mouse. Students with physical impairments may need to use an adapted mouse or a computer with eye- scanning capabilities. Students who are visually impaired or blind may need enlarged or brailled text and picture descriptions of art. Illustrations that need to be interpreted will need to have detailed written descriptions in order for them to be accessible for students who are blind. Students with reading disabilities may need to read the text to themselves, or use trackers or maskers to follow along. Students with visual-processing impairments may benefit from using a tracker or masker when reading. Other formats or supports may be necessary for students with other disabilities. The accommodations listed here are suggestions and could be altered depending on what accommodations will be allowable. Refer to the *Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium: Usability, Accessibility, and Accommodations Guidelines* for information on accessibility concerns.',

Stimuli for research (two for Grade 3) should have some references and footnotes/in-text citations resembling authentic research sources.\r\n\r\n-   The set of sources should provide enough evidence that allows students to establish and support a main idea, rather than simply restating the ideas within the sources. Sources should not be encyclopedic or too general.\r\n\r\n-   The set of sources should together provide a comprehensive and richer collection of information than any one source alone and should encourage integration of information. Sources need some overlap of ideas to allow for analysis across texts.\r\n\r\n-   Overall, the sources should offer more factual information and citations than just unsupported opinions.\r\n\r\n**Literary fiction texts:** Includes the subgenres of narrative fiction, short stories, poetry, and song lyrics.\r\n\r\n-   Stories or other works of fiction are not appropriate for the Grade 3–5 research tasks. Do not use literary fiction in Grade 3–5 tasks.\r\n\r\n**Visual/graphic sources:** Includes the subgenres of data tables and graphs, maps, info-graphics, timelines, diagrams, photographs, drawings, and artwork.\r\n\r\n-   In any set of textual stimuli for research, visual/graphic sources that are included within the stimuli must serve a purpose other than to simply break up the text (e.g., making an abstract concept, idea, or process described in the source more understandable, providing additional information relevant to understanding the topic or subtopic). They should be highly relevant to the topic or subtopic of the source, and not introduce distracting or irrelevant information.\r\n\r\n-   Visuals should not be so complicated that they add to the reading load.\r\n\r\n-   Care should be taken in the selection of visual/graphic sources in consideration of accessibility issues for students with visual impairments. However, not ALL tasks must be accessible for visually impaired students.\r\n\r\n-   For Grade 3 Performance Tasks, where there are only 2 sources, visuals may be included *within* the sources as delineated in bullets above.',

The vocabulary used in the stimulus and the item should be on or below grade level. In some instances, vocabulary may be above grade level as long as the stimulus has sufficient context to support the meaning of the word. In other cases, a complex authentic source that is at a reading level above the target grade (i.e., a historical primary source document) may be included, but these should be used with caution and with appropriate supports (e.g., historical context, definitions of key terms).',
