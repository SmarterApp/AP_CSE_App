> React frontend application for the Smarter Balanced Content Specification Explorer project. The backend can be viewed [here](https://github.com/osu-cass/AP-CSE-API), while a development deployment of this application is available [at this link](https://ap-cse-app.now.sh).

## Developing

To get started, clone the repo and install all dependencies:

```sh
# From a directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com/osu-cass/AP-CSE-APP

# Enter the cloned repo
cd AP-CSE-APP

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

To begin working on AP-CSE-APP, you have two choices: Run Storybook for component development, or run the frontend application with `webpack`.

### Storybook

To launch Storybook, run the following command:

```sh
# Launch Storybook at http://localhost:9001
npm run storybook
```

Code changes should be automagically loaded into Storybook with the page loaded.

### Full Application

To run the application locally, run the following command:

```sh
# Run the application at http://localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

Once again, any code changes should automatically be loaded without needing to refresh.
